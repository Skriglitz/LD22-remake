# LD22 - Remake

This project is a complete rewrite from scratch of the old Lava Jumper game written for Ludum Dare 22. The idea is to rewrite the entire game, fixing the core bugs it had, and possibly bring up to date with a more modern codebase and framework. Code was based on LWJGL 2.x originally, will first rewrite, then later rewrite again in LWJGL 3.x. 

May not be fully functional yet but will work on as time allows.
